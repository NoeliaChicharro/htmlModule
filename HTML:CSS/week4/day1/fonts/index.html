<!-- to insert fonts just use the 'font-family' tag. 
if u wanna use other fonts u have to improt them (@import).
Do this before the reset. it has to be downloadet!
to check the font go to 'caniuse.com' (shows which browser let's u use the font-format.) use WOF to be sure!

where i get fonts?
google fonts (on here, all should be free), adobe,  (but be carful, not all of them are free) 

how to use those fonts?
just import them as told above. this will be written in the html file (not in css file!)

use fallback fonts! if some user can't see the original font, there's a fall back. 
(sans-serif is on every device and every browser)

what we wanna use own fonts?
put the file into the used folder and link them to the file with @font-face. 

Remember: never ever use px for font size. use rem (or em) to update the size depending on the device and soom size.
If you're not sure if u should use rem or em, use rem.:) default 16px = 1rem -->
