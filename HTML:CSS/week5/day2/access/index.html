<!-- What can i do to get better accessebility? 
screenreders, keybord navigation, contrast, zoom possibility
WCAG these are the accessebility guide lines for web. (with different niveau) 

hardware: sometimes we can't use a normal keybord. so there are different options. 
there are tools who check if your page is readable for color-blinde people.

Every time u add accessability u have to get rid of a design part. (find the balance)
the min is: alt-attributes(for images) , title-attributes(), transcription(a discription 1:1 what on a audio or video is),
skip links(navication structures, right after the body tag. for screeenreaders, HAS TO BE) 

Check if your alt-attribut really describs the image! not just a word! (HAS TO BE)
offscreen descrition: just put it out of view range! and give it a width of 1px. (as span p.e.)

Ask your selfe is it really necessary to get access?

how accessiblle should be my page:
min. alt-attributes and skip-links 
check it on a w3c validation service!
make audit tests (inspector)

Generall:
- if your not doing a personal site go for the A minimum.
- non-text content: needs a alt-attribute 
- autio and video only: should have an alternative
- captions: subtext
- info and relationship: logical sturucure (semantic tags)
- colors: if there's content just color changed, let it be
- keybord access: user can use the site without mouse usage
- baypass block: skip-links
- labels or instructions: forms/inputs shloud always have labels 
(if u can't get all of them for your site, don't worry!)

title-attributes:
- are used in links and images (normally)
- show a message if u hover over an item or an image
- buuut, if u have to many title-attributes the screenreader can't read your site.
- use it on an imput where no label is found
- now a days titles are not really used any more!
(martin recomends not to use them)

aria-attributes:
- is aria-attributes helps to gets information
- role, decribs what the container does
- u can give them values.. aria-checkt(the second parts is your own choise)
- aria-hidden: is the most important one. if u wanna hide an element for all and screenreaders use this. 
- aria-label: to mark the different site sections.
